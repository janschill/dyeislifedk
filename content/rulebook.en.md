## The Set-Up

* To play Beer Die (also referred to as dye), you will need a 4’ by 8’ long plywood table with a dividing line going through the middle (vertically). It needs to be roughly 3 to 3 ½' off the ground
* We would recommend getting 5 ply pine plywood 1/2" thick
* 4 Pint size glasses placed finger (or hands) lengths distance from each corner
* 2 Dice
* 4 Players
* Beer of choice
* Each player before the game starts must fill one full beer in their cup
* A full beer (can) is placed in the center of the table. This beer is the mine - more about this under 'Other rules'.
* And lastly before you begin playing you want to set a height boundary (usually 3-4 meters) - this is how high the die must be tossed on every toss

## The Rules

#### First Toss

To decide which team tosses first, one person rolls a die and the other team calls high or low. If the die is a 4, 5, or 6 that is high. If the die is a 1, 2, or 3 that is low. If they called it right, they are awarded first toss.

#### To Win

Games are played up to 10 points. A beer is killed and filled every 5 points, meaning that you have to empty your cup when your opponents reach 5 points and again when they reach 10 points. Games are always won by 2. The losing team drinks whatever the winning team has left in their cups.

#### How to Score a Point

To score a point the die must be tossed above the discussed height and bounce off any part of the opponent's side of the table, if the die is not caught after the die bounces off the table it's a point. One person tosses at a time per team. Before a player tosses he or she has to yell 'DYE UP!' - if the player forgets the toss cannot award any points, but all other rules do still apply.

A die can bounce anywhere after it hits the defending teams side, it could even bounce back towards the side from whence it was tossed. As long as it connects with the defending half of table and falls to the ground, it is a point. To prevent a point, a defensive player must catch the die with ONE hand in OPEN AIR before it hits the ground. If the player uses both hands to catch the die, it is a point for the offensive team.

Once one die is thrown and either caught or dropped and the defending team is ready, the next die is tossed. When die is tossed too low and it only takes one person from the defending team to call height before the die hits the table, which generally speaking is a pretty obvious call.

If the die lands short (on the tossing teams side of the table) or on the dividing line it is dead and goes to the opposing team. If there is a heated discussion on whether the die landed short or not, it is a re-toss - this is a general rule, that applies to all other discussion as well.

If the die is trapped (i.e. movement of the die is halted by applying pressure with hand or other body part) against the body or any other surrounding object, then it is a point for the tossing team.

Catching a die over the table is never allowed and result in a point for the opposite team regardless of the situation.

A die that hits a cup and falls off the table without being caught is 2 points.

A sink is awarded 2 points and the defending team must kill and fill their beer regardless of the score. A sink can be a direct shot into the cup or a bounce in. If a player is sunk, he kills and fills, and on the next point scored by the opponents he has to keep up with his or her partner's beer. If the partner only has one sip left, the sunk player must as well. If you sink your own cup, it counts as if the opponents had sunk you.

#### FIFAs:

Any toss from the offensive team that misses the table can be kicked up by one of the defensive players and caught by the adjacent defensive player for a point. They also get to keep the die for the ensuing offensive turn. Game cannot be won (or lost) off a FIFA.

- It is allowed to use everything but the thigh for perfoming a FIFA.

- When a defending player kicks a die, by doing so, he/she is keeping the die alive and in play. A Fifa is performed by using the foot or head.

#### Scoring FIFAs:

If the die is Fifa'd and caught by the other defending player it is a point for their team.
If the die is Fifa'd and lands on the defending tables side, and then falls off the table without being caught, ﻿it is a point for the offensive team. The die was put back in play.
If the die is Fifa'd and hits the defending sides cup then hits the ground it is 2 points. Again, in this scenario, the die was put back in play.
If the die is Fifa'd and lands in the defending sides cup it counts as a sink - 2 points and it is a kill & fill.
If the die is Fifa'd and hits the offensives sides table or cup. No points are awarded, however if the offensive side cup is SUNK. That will be awarded a kill n fill for the offensive side.


#### Other rules

* Naked Lap (Naked Mile): if a team is skunked (losses 10 to 0) then they must run around the block completely naked.
* The MINE: if the mine in the center of the table is hit with a die at ANY TIME, the throwing player (or spectator) must shotgun the beer. No points are awarded to any of the teams by this action.
* 'Fiver on the table': if the die is tossed, stays on the table and it's a fiver, the tossing player must kill n fill his or her beer. The toss does not award any points.

#### Rare Circumstances:

* Bounce out sink and caught: If the die bounces out, the defense is allowed to make a play on the die but ONLY WHEN IT COMES OFF THE TABLE.

* Bounce on tossing teams side but sinks the defending teams cup: ﻿no points are awarded, but the player sunk on must kill and fill.
