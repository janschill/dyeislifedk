## Tournament bracket

The tournament bracket will be announced as soon as all teams have registered. We will play a **Double Elimination Tourney**, which means every team starts in bracket A. When they lose a game, they move to bracket B and have another chance of reaching the final. If you lose a game in bracket B you are out. More information [below](#double-elimination).

Playing against team “Jonads”? Don‘t know who it is? Check out the [overview](#overview-of-the-teams) of all teams at the bottom of the page.

This bracket is a preview and **subject to change** until the tournament is started.

### Double Elimination

“A **double-elimination tournament** is a type of elimination tournament competition in which a participant ceases to be eligible to win the tournament's championship upon having lost two games or matches. It stands in contrast to a single-elimination tournament, in which only one defeat results in elimination.

One method of arranging a double-elimination tournament is to break the competitors into two sets of brackets, the winners bracket and losers bracket (W and L brackets for short; also sometimes upper bracket and lower bracket, respectively) after the first round. The first-round winners proceed into the W bracket and the losers proceed into the L bracket. The W bracket is conducted in the same manner as a single-elimination tournament, except that the losers of each round "drop down" into the L bracket.”
