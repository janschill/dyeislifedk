  description="Karl is probably the most consistent player to exist. His table hit rate comes in on 97%. This is what a semester in the USA with every day Dyeing does with you. He is also the only one from us who had to do a naked run (There is a video online)."

  description="Fifa a controversial part of the game is defended by Hans rigorously. People tell stories of him juggling a dice multiple times and practically serving it on a silver platter to his teammate. One time he kicked it multiple meters in the air, it was caught (by butterfingerjan). He is also known of aiming straight for the mine."

  description="Rasmus played one or two games and was then never seen to play again. One theory is that he did not like the idea of a dice having six sides, he is probably busy sketching prototypes for a new dice, that he could patent, sell and make into a technology company."
