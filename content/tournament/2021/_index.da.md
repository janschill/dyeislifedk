## Tournament bracket

The tournament bracket will be announced as soon as all teams have registered. We will play a **Double Elimination Tourney**, which means every team starts in bracket A. When they lose a game, they move to bracket B and have another chance of reaching the final. If you lose a game in bracket B you are out. More information [below](#double-elimination).

Playing against team “Jonads”? Don‘t know who it is? Check out the [overview](#overview-of-the-teams) of all teams at the bottom of the page.

This bracket is a preview and **subject to change** until the tournament is started.
