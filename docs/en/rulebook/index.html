<h2 id="the-set-up">The Set-Up</h2>
<ul>
<li>To play Beer Die (also referred to as dye), you will need a 4’ by 8’ (feet) plywood table with a dividing line going through the middle (vertically). It should be roughly 3 to 3 ½' off the ground</li>
<li>We recommend getting 5 ply pine plywood 1/2&quot; (inches) thick</li>
<li>4 Pint size glasses - 1 glass placed in each of the table&rsquo;s four corners</li>
<li>2 Dice</li>
<li>4 Players (2 teams of 2 players)</li>
<li>Beer of choice</li>
<li>Each player before the game starts must fill one full beer in their cup</li>
<li>A full beer (can) is placed in the center of the table. This beer is the mine - more about this under &lsquo;Other rules&rsquo;</li>
<li>And lastly before you begin playing you want to set a height boundary (usually 3-4 meters) - this is how high the die must be tossed on every toss</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-rules">The Rules</h2>
<h3 id="first-toss">First Toss</h3>
<p>To decide which team tosses first, one person rolls a die and the other team calls high or low. If the die is a 4, 5, or 6, it is high. If the die is a 1, 2, or 3, it is low. If they called it right, they are awarded first toss (one toss for each player on the team).</p>
<h3 id="to-win">To Win</h3>
<p>Games are played up to 10 points. A beer is killed and filled every 5 points, meaning that you have to empty your cup when your opponents reach 5 points and again when they reach 10 points. Games are always won by 2. The losing team drinks whatever the winning team has left in their cups.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-score-a-point">How to Score a Point</h3>
<p>To score a point the die must be tossed above the discussed height and hit the defending team&rsquo;s side of the table or one of their cups directly. If the die bounces off the table without being caught by the defending team, it&rsquo;s a point for the attacking team. One person tosses at a time per team. Before a player tosses he or she has to yell &lsquo;DYE UP!&rsquo; - if the player forgets the toss cannot award any points, but all other rules do still apply.</p>
<p>A die can bounce off the table anywhere after it hits the defending teams side, it could even bounce back towards the side from where it was tossed. As long as it defending half of table FIRST and falls to the ground, it is a point. To prevent a point, a defensive player must catch the die with ONE hand in OPEN AIR before it hits the ground. If the player uses both hands to catch the die, it is a point for the offensive team. If the die is trapped (i.e. movement of the die is halted by applying pressure with hand or other body part) against the body or any other surrounding object, then it is a point for the tossing team.</p>
<p>Once one die is thrown and either caught or dropped and the defending team is ready, the next die is tossed. When a die is tossed too low, it only takes one person from the defending team to call &lsquo;height&rsquo; before the die hits the table, which generally speaking is a pretty obvious call. This can be a cause of great discussion, but if there&rsquo;s doubt often time it has been too low. dyeislife.dk encourage high tosses and beautiful form (tossing style).</p>
<p>If the die lands short (on the tossing teams side of the table) or on the dividing line it is dead and goes to the opposing team. If there is a heated discussion on whether the die landed short or not, it is a re-toss - this is a general rule, that applies to all other discussion as well.</p>
<p>Catching a die over the table is never allowed and result in a point for the opposite team regardless of the situation.</p>
<p>A die that hits a cup and falls off the table without being caught is 2 points - provided that the die has hit the defending team&rsquo;s half first or hits one of the defending team&rsquo;s cups directly.</p>
<p>A sink is awarded 2 points and the defending team must kill and fill their beer regardless of the score. A sink can be a direct shot into the cup or a bounce in. If a player is sunk, he or she kills and fills, and on the next point scored by the opponents he or she has to keep up with his or her partner&rsquo;s beer. If the partner only has one sip left, the sunk player must as well. If you sink your own cup, it counts as if the opponents had sunk you. This is obviously extremely shameful - the shame and disgrace of the team mate should feel even worse than the kill n' fill plus two points for the opponents, which is collected.</p>
<h3 id="fifas">FIFAs:</h3>
<p>Any toss from the offensive team that misses the table can be kicked up by one of the defensive players and caught by the adjacent defensive player for a point. They also get to keep the die for the ensuing offensive turn. Game cannot be won (or lost) off a FIFA.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is allowed to use everything but the thigh/knee (kneefa) for performing a FIFA.</li>
<li>When a defending player kicks a die, by doing so, he/she is keeping the die alive and in play - hence all other rules still apply.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scoring-fifas">Scoring FIFAs:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the die is Fifa&rsquo;d and caught by the other defending player it is a point for their team</li>
<li>If the die is Fifa&rsquo;d and lands on the defending tables side, and then falls off the table without being caught, it is a point for the offensive team - the die was kept alive</li>
<li>If the die is Fifa&rsquo;d and hits the defending side&rsquo;s cup then hits the ground it is 2 points for the offensive team. Again, in this scenario, the die was put back in play</li>
<li>If the die is Fifa&rsquo;d and lands in the defending side&rsquo;s cup it counts as a sink - 2 points and it is a kill &amp; fill</li>
<li>If the die is Fifa&rsquo;d and hits the offensives sides table or cup. No points are awarded, however if the offensive side cup is SUNK. That will be awarded a kill n fill for the offensive side</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-rules">Other rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>Naked Lap (Naked Mile): if a team is skunked (losses 10 to 0) then they must run around the block completely naked.</li>
<li>The MINE: if the mine in the center of the table is hit with a die at ANY TIME, the throwing player (or spectator) must shotgun the beer. No points are awarded to any of the teams by this action. If the die hits the mine and goes directly to the ground without hitting the table, it is not possible to make the call “short or long”, and hence the tossing player is awarded a retoss. The mine has to be chucked anyway – of course.</li>
<li>&lsquo;Fiver on the table&rsquo;: if the die is tossed, stays on the table and it&rsquo;s a fiver, the tossing player must kill n fill his or her beer. The toss does not award any points.</li>
<li>Semi-contact: Dye is a semi-kontakt sport. It is not allowed to tackle your opponent (neither as the offensive or defensive team). However, it is always allowed to stand your ground in the position at the moment of the toss. As a defending player this is behind the table or from the position where the tossing player lands after a jumping toss.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rare-circumstances">Rare Circumstances:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bounce out sink and caught: If the die bounces out, the defense is allowed to make a play on the die but ONLY WHEN IT COMES OFF THE TABLE.</li>
<li>Bounce on tossing teams side but sinks the defending teams cup: no points are awarded, but the player sunk on must kill and fill.</li>
<li>A player kicks, punches or in any other way make the table vibrate to a degree that causes one or several beers to tumble: The guilty player kills ‘n fills. If the person’s beer has tumbled he/she fills, kills n’ fills.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alternative-rules">Alternative rules:</h3>
<p>The following rules are additions to the standard rulebook, that the two playing teams can choose to follow. In that case the teams have to agree on which of the additions that are played by.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ladder: If the teams decide to play with ‘Ladder’, one additional passing has to be added for each point scored by FIFA. Thus, the first FIFA can be scored in the regular way. To score the second FIFA player 1 has to pass the die to player 2, who must pass it back before it can be catched and award the team one point. To score the next FIFA (number three) an additional pass has to be added before the die is catched, and so forth. All standard rules regarding FIFAs are still applicable.</li>
<li>‘NEVER fiver on the table’: Hvis this rule is applied, a die can never be placed on the table with five eyes pointing to the sky. If this happens it triggers a kill n’ fill to the guilty player. Notice that this rule adds to the standard rule ‘Fiver on the table’, so that it also applies to non-tosses.</li>
<li>Psycho-FIFA: If the rule is applied the offensive team can tackle the defending team as soon as the defending team tries to score a FIFA and the die is still in-air. In this case the restrictions from the rule ‘Semi-contact’ is repealed.</li>
</ul>
